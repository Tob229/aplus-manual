Question groups
===============

Questions in a questionnaire can be grouped.
It is possible to change normal grading so that
students earn points from a question group only
if they answer all questions inside the question group correctly.
This grading behavior is enabled by the setting ``group_errors``
in the config.yaml file of the questionnaire.


.. admonition:: Only YAML
  :class: warning

  Question groups can currently only be defined in the YAML format, not directly in RST directives.


Below, there is an example questionnaire that has two question groups.
The ``group_errors`` setting is enabled in both question groups.
The config.yaml file of the questionnaire is also highlighted below.
